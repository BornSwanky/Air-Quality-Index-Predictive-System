# Air Quality Index Predictive System

The Air Quality Index Predictive System utilizes a comprehensive environmental dataset to forecast air quality levels. The system incorporates a graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction and ease of access to air quality predictions.


## Files

- AQI_GUI: This Python file implements the GUI, allowing users to input data and receive predictions regarding the air quality index.

- background: A background image file used in the GUI interface.

- Programming: This Python file contains the code responsible for training the predictive model using the environmental dataset.

- AQI_Report: A detailed report in PDF format that documents the methodology, results, and findings of the project.
## Dataset

The model is trained using an environmental dataset that includes variables such as
- Year
- Month
- Day
- Hour
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind Speed
- Air Quality Index
- Noise Level
- Precipitation
- Solar Radiation
